## Fixes explained

- The constructor initializes the owner variable with the address of the sender. 
- There is a potential issue in this store function: the use of an uninitialized storage pointer `(Storage str;)`. It's safer to create a new instance using `Storage memory str = Storage(msg.sender, _amount);`.
- Initialize the storage pointer in the store function to avoid potential issues.
- Consider using a more stable Solidity version to benefit from improvements and security features.
- Added a license identifier.
